    At any given moment there are four types of salt in my kitchen. Rock salt ground onto meats and fish. Fine popcorn
    salt tossed with freshly-popped kernels in a paper bag. Pink Himalayan salt gathering dust until it finds its true
    calling. Crystalline English sea salt delivered as a finishing touch to any and every dish. Sodium chloride salt
    comprises the vast majority of salts and mine are no exception. So how does such a simple molecule produce such
    variety?

    Salt varieties that have come into popular use differ in color, flavor, texture, and even smell. They all conjure
    that taste we describe as "salty," but from where do these other properties arise? Some come from the salt itself.
    Others are a result of compounds, impurities, present in the salt. These compounds can impart their character on the
    salt in desirable ways.

    Grey salt, <em>sel gris</em>, gets its color from the clay on which it dries. The presence of iron sulfides in black salt,
    <em>kala namak</em>, give it both its color and its pungent eggy smell. Producers smoke some salts with hardwoods after
    harvesting to add earthiness. Others add herbs, spices, and aromatics to complement meats or vegetables.
